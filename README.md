# tic-tac-toe-game
Modified tic tac toe game that takes user input to determine the dimensions of the game. 
- Specifically, player is to select an integer x between 3 and 9 (inclusive), which will render a tic-tac-toe game of x-by-x squares.

Additionally, user input is also taken to determine the difficulty while playing against the computer. User can select from three levels of difficulty - Easy, Medium and Difficult.
- When on easy mode, the computer makes its moves purely iteratively, from left to right, and top to bottom; it is predictable and does not require logic to win. 
- When on medium mode, the computer makes its moves randomly, making the game less predictable. 
- When on difficult mode, the computer makes its moves based on the minimax algorithm and an evaluation function, acting as the minimising player of the game. This makes the game much harder to win.
